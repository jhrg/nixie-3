# Bug Log

Convention: `BUG-###`, sequential, never renumbered. Status: `Open` → `Investigating`
→ `Fix Planned` → `Fixed` → (or `Won't Fix` / `Duplicate of BUG-0XX`). **Only the user
sets a bug to `Fixed`** — that's a claim about verified deployed behavior, not
something to self-report from having written a fix plan.

## BUG-EXAMPLE — Password reset link accepted after expiry

*(delete this section once you've seen the shape)*

**Severity:** High
**Status:** Fix Planned
**Reported:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Related requirements:** FR-EXAMPLE, UC-EXAMPLE (violates the "time-limited" part of both)
**Fix plan:** `plans/bugfix-reset-link-expiry-plan.md`

**Reproduction steps:**
1. Request a password reset
2. Wait past the stated expiry window (currently 1 hour)
3. Follow the link anyway

**Expected behavior:** Link is rejected with an "expired, request a new one" message
(per FR-EXAMPLE).

**Actual behavior:** Link still succeeds and resets the password.

**Root cause:** Expiry is checked against token creation time using the token's own
embedded claim, but that claim is client-suppliable and never verified against issue
time recorded server-side. *(Fill this in during investigation — leave `TBD` until
actually found in the code, not guessed from symptoms.)*

     steps yet is a symptom report, not a bug entry — get concrete steps before
     assigning an ID if at all possible. -->
