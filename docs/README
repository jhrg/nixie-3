Scope images showing the affect of adding a resistor from the anode to
ground (marked 'w-gnd') so that anode current can drain off when using
PWM to control brightness of a nixe tube. Measured using the 'nixe-3'
board where each tube has its own BCD to dec driver 74151 which
are each connected to a 74HC595 serial to 8-bit parallel chip.

This shows that adding the resistor does not make much difference in the
turn off time and no difference in the turn on time. The images were taken
at the brightest and dimest PWN settings.
